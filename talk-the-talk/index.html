              <h2>Copay</h2>

              <p>The flat, or fixed, dollar amount you pay for certain types of covered care. You might pay $30 for a doctor visit and the insurance company will pick up the rest. Plans with higher premiums generally have lower copays, and vice versa. Some plans do not have copays at all.

              <p>The most you pay in a plan year for covered expenses before your insurance begins to pay 100% of the allowed amount. It is the total of your deductible, copays, and coinsurance (but does not include your premiums). There are usually separate maximums for in - and out-of-network care. Plans with higher premiums generally have lower out-of-pocket limits.</p>

              <p>The shared cost for a covered health service. It's calculated as a percentage &mdash; you pay a portion and the health plan pays the rest. Plans with higher premiums generally pick up a larger portion of the bill. Coinsurance typically begins after you've paid the full deductible amount.</p>

              <p>Routine health care that includes checkups, patient counseling, and screenings to prevent disease, illness, and other health complications. Preventive care is typically covered at 100% in-network. If the same tests are done to diagnose an illness or treat a known condition, they are not considered preventive care and the deductible and coinsurance apply.</p>

              <p>An in-network provider is a health care provider who has contracted with the health plan or insurer to provide services for individuals covered under the plan at a negotiated rate. An out-of-network provider is a health care provider who does not have such a relationship with the plan. A plan often only covers the cost of services from in-network providers, or, if the plan covers the cost of out-of-network services, you will usually pay more for those services.</p>

<h1>IMPORTANT  FSA GUIDELINES</h1>

<ul>

  <li>You  can use your 2014 FSA contributions for eligible expenses incurred from January  1, 2014, through March 15, 2015.</li>

  <li>If  you have unused funds in your 2013 Health Care FSA, Dependent Care FSA, and/or  Limited Purpose Health Care FSA, those funds will automatically be used first  to pay eligible expenses incurred between January 1, 2013, and March 15, 2014.</li>

  <li> You contribute to the Health Care Flexible Spending Account over a 12-month plan year, from January 1 to December 31 (or fewer months, if you start or stop participating during the plan year). You may use your Health Care Flexible Spending Account to pay for eligible expenses incurred during the plan year. If you have a balance remaining in your Health Care Flexible Spending Account after December 31 of the plan year, you have an additional 2&frac12;-month grace period (until March 15 of the following plan year) to incur eligible expenses (provided you were still participating on December 31 of the plan year and excluding expenses incurred after your employment ends). You then have until May 31 to submit for reimbursement eligible expenses you incur during the plan year and during the grace period. </li>

  <li>In accordance with IRS rules, you will forfeit any account balance not used to pay eligible expenses incurred by March 15 of the following plan year (the end of the grace period) if they are not submitted by May 31.</li>

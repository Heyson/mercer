<h1>ELIGIBILITY FOR BENEFITS COVERAGE</h1>



  <p>You are eligible to receive benefits upon meeting the  requirements listed in your Summary Plan Description. You may also elect coverage for certain members of your family, as  outlined below.</p>

  <p> <strong>If you elect coverage  for yourself, you may also elect medical, dental, vision, life insurance, and  AD&amp;D insurance coverage for eligible family members, including:</strong></p>

<ul class="circle_list">

    <li>Your legally defined spouse/domestic partner.</li>

    <li>Your children under age 26 (eligible for  medical, dental, and vision coverage until the end of the month in which they turn age 26).</li>

    <li>Your unmarried dependent children under age 26  (eligible for child life insurance and AD&amp;D insurance coverage until the end of the month in which they turn age 26).</li>

    <li>Unmarried incapacitated children.*</li>

  </ul>

  <p class="disclaimer">

*Incapacitated children include children who were under age 19 and dependent  upon you for financial support at the time they became incapacitated.</p>

  <p> Dependent children include natural children, legally adopted  children, children living with you whom you are in the process of adopting, stepchildren,  your domestic partner&rsquo;s children, foster children, children for whom you have  been appointed legal guardian, and children for whom you are required by court  order to provide health coverage.</p>

  <p> <strong>When coverage ends</strong><br />    

  Benefits coverage for you and any enrolled dependents will  end on the day your employment is terminated or when you are no longer  eligible. Coverage for dependents will also end when they no longer meet the  definition of dependents under the plan. If you or your covered dependents lose  coverage, you have the option to continue your group health coverage for a  designated period, as required under COBRA (Consolidated Omnibus Budget  Reconciliation Act of 1985) law. To continue your coverage, you will need to  complete the COBRA Election Form that our COBRA administrator will send to you  following the loss of coverage. Note that you can also elect continued coverage  by logging on to <a href="http://www.ceridian-benefits.com" target="_blank">www.ceridian-benefits.com</a> or  by calling <strong>800-877-7994</strong>.  </p>

  <p> <strong>Keep in mind</strong><br />

    If you are related to another associate (your  spouse/domestic partner) who is eligible for Bosch health and welfare benefits,  you may elect to cover yourself only or be covered as a dependent for your  medical, dental, and vision care benefits, but not both. If you and your  spouse/domestic partner work for Bosch, only one of you may cover your  children. You may not have double coverage for yourself or your dependents  under the Bosch health and welfare plan.</p>

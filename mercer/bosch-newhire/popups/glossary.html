<h1>SOME HELPFUL DEFINITIONS</h1>

<ul class="circle_list">

  <li><strong>Coinsurance</strong> – The percentage the plan  pays once you meet the annual deductible in your CDHP.</li>

  <li><strong>Deductible</strong> – The amount of expenses you  must pay each plan year before the plan begins to pay coinsurance (plans have  individual or family deductibles).</li>

  <li><strong>Domestic partner</strong> – An individual of the same  or opposite gender and at least age 18 with whom you share a permanent address,  have been in a relationship for at least six months, are financially  interdependent and jointly responsible for each other&rsquo;s common welfare, are not  closely related by blood as to prohibit a legal marriage, and intend to remain  in a committed relationship; and neither partner has been in a different  domestic partner relationship or marriage within the last six months.</li>

  <li><strong>Network</strong> – A group of providers who  contract with a healthcare carrier to provide services to its members at negotiated  rates.</li>

  <li><strong>Out-of-network</strong> – Out-of-network providers can be contracted or noncontracted. Payment to noncontracted providers is based on medicare reimbursement rates. Noncontracted providers can balance bill you for the difference between the medicare reimbursement rate and the amount charged by the provider. Please ask your out-of-network provider if they are contracted with BCBSIL or not.</li>

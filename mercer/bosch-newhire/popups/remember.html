<h1>You have choices to make this Annual Enrollment</h1>



<p>Like last year, your current medical coverage will not carry over to  2014. That means you must actively enroll between October 28 and November 15,  2013, in order to receive the medical plan coverage of your choice for 2014. If  you are currently enrolled in a medical plan and do not take any action, you  will automatically be enrolled in the Consumer Directed Health Plan (CDHP) for  2014. (<strong>Exception</strong>: Employees on Long-Term Disability or who are enrolled  in the HMSA plans will remain enrolled in their 2013 coverage for 2014 if they  take no action.) In addition, you must also enroll if you want to participate  in a Health Savings Account or Flexible Spending Account in 2014. Your enrollment  in these accounts will not carry over to the 2014 plan year.</p>

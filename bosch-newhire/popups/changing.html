<h1>CHANGING COVERAGE DURING THE YEAR</h1>



  <p>The benefit choices you make as a Bosch associate will remain in effect until March 31, 2017. You cannot change your coverage during  the plan year unless you incur a qualifying life event. The Internal Revenue  Service (IRS) defines a qualifying life event as a change in:</p>

<ul class="circle_list">

  <li><strong>Marital  status:</strong> Marriage, divorce, legal separation, or annulment.</li>

    <li><strong>Domestic  partnership:</strong> Beginning or ending a domestic partnership.</li>

    <li><strong>Number of  dependents:</strong> Birth, adoption, placement for adoption, or death.</li>

    <li><strong>Employment  status:</strong> Beginning or ending employment or change in work schedule by you,  your spouse/domestic partner, or your dependent if it affects eligibility.</li>

    <li><strong>Dependent  status:</strong> Gain or loss of eligibility because of age.</li>

    <li><strong>Spouse/domestic  partner&rsquo;s Annual Enrollment:</strong> Changes made by your spouse/domestic partner  that Impact your benefit elections.</li>

  </ul>

<p><strong>Qualified Medical  Child Support Order (QMCSO)</strong><br />    

You may also change coverage during the plan year if you  receive a QMCSO, which may be either a National Medical Child Support Notice  issued by a state child support agency or an order or judgment from a state  court or administrative body directing the Company to cover a child under the  plan. Federal law provides that a QMCSO must meet certain form and content  requirements in order to be valid.</p>

<p> For more information about qualifying life events, Including  QMCSOs, please refer to your Summary Plan Description (SPD) available on the  Bosch Benefits Web site or call the Bosch Benefits Center at <strong>800-207-9012</strong> (857-362-5996 internationally).</p>

  <p> <strong>Important!</strong><br />    

  When you experience a qualifying life event, you have 60  days from the date of the event to access the Bosch Benefits Web site or call  the Bosch Benefits Center and change your benefit elections (changes must be  related to the qualifying life event). If you do not make changes within 60  days, you will have to wait until the next Annual Enrollment period to make  benefit elections related to that qualifying event.</p>

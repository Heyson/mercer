      <div class="acc-container" style="width:620px;">
        <div class="content">
          <p>Bosch automatically provides basic associate life insurance at no cost to  you. Your benefit is equal to your annual base pay rounded up to  the next $1,000 and multiplied by two. For example, if your pay is $45,300, your annual base coverage is $46,000 times two, or $92,000. </p>
          
          
 <p>You may reduce the level of your basic associate life insurance to  as low as one times your annual base pay, in which case you will receive a  credit that can be applied to the cost of your other benefits.</p>         
          
          <p>You may also purchase additional associate life insurance coverage up to a  maximum of eight times your annual base pay (rounded up to the next $1,000),  up to a maximum of $2 million. In addition to choosing this additional,  portable life insurance for yourself, you may also elect the following optional  coverage for your family:</p>
          <ul class="circle_list">
            <li><strong>Spouse/domestic  partner life insurance (up to age 70):</strong> Coverage is available at the  following levels: $10,000, $25,000, $50,000, $75,000, or $100,000. Note that  your spouse/domestic partner life insurance coverage level can&rsquo;t exceed the  level of your combined basic and optional life insurance coverage.</li>
            <li><strong>Child  life insurance:</strong> Coverage is available for your dependent children  age six months to age 26 at the following  levels: $5,000 and $10,000 per child. For children age one day to six months,  the plan pays a maximum of $1,000 per child in the event of death.</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p><strong>Evidence of  Insurability (EOI)</strong><br>
            If you elect to increase the level  of your life insurance benefit for yourself or your spouse/domestic partner, you  may need to provide proof of good health, also known as Evidence of  Insurability (EOI). <a class="fancybox fancybox.iframe" href="popups/eoi.html">Learn more</a>.</p>
          <p><strong>Annual base pay</strong><br>
          Coverage is based on your pay in effect on the January 1 prior to the beginning of the plan year. Base pay includes your salary, any elective deferred compensation and pre-tax premiums, FSA contributions, and elective 401(k) plan contributions. Base pay does not include any overtime pay, bonuses, shift differential pay, relocation pay, or employer-paid retirement or fringe benefits not normally included in cash compensation.</p>
          <p>For sales associates earning commission, any commission sales wages paid in the last 24-month period will be averaged and annualized for this period. The calculated annualized commission amount will then be added to your benefit salary affecting benefit coverage and contributions. This &quot;look back&quot; will be calculated each January 1 with the benefit commission wage used for the entire plan year. For purposes of determining your coverage, your annual base pay will be rounded to the nearest thousand.          </p>

        <div class="content">
          <p>AD&amp;D insurance provides coverage if you die accidentally or become  seriously injured. Bosch automatically provides basic AD&amp;D (associate only)  insurance equal to two times your annual base pay rounded up to the next $1,000 and multiplied by two, at no cost to you. </p>
          
  <p>You may reduce the level of your basic AD&amp;D (associate only) coverage to as low as  one times your annual base pay, in which case you will receive a credit that  can be applied to the cost of your other benefits.</p>

          <p>Besides choosing additional AD&amp;D coverage for yourself, you may also  elect the following forms of optional coverage for your family:</p>
          <ul class="circle_list">
            <li><strong>Spouse/domestic  partner:</strong> Benefit would equal 60% of associate AD&amp;D  coverage.</li>

            <li><strong>Family:</strong> Benefit would equal 50% of associate AD&amp;D coverage for spouse/domestic  partner; 10% for children.</li>

In addition  to the basic benefit, you have the option to purchase additional LTD coverage  for a total income replacement benefit of 65% of your monthly base pay. The  combined maximum monthly benefit for basic and optional LTD coverage is  $18,000.</p>
